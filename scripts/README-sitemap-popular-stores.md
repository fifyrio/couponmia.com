# Sitemap Popular Stores Update Script

## Overview

The `update-sitemap-popular-stores.js` script automatically calculates and updates the top 5 most popular stores in the `sitemap.xml` file based on database popularity metrics.

## Features

- **Automatic Popularity Calculation**: Calculates store popularity scores based on multiple factors
- **Database Integration**: Queries Supabase database for real-time store data
- **Sitemap Update**: Automatically updates `public/sitemap.xml` with new top stores
- **Backup Creation**: Creates backup of original sitemap before making changes
- **Integration with Daily Sync**: Integrated into the `sync-today.js` workflow

## Popularity Scoring Algorithm

The script calculates store popularity using the following weighted scoring system:

### Scoring Components (Total: 100 points)

1. **Featured Store Status** (50 points)
   - `is_featured: true` = 50 points
   - `is_featured: false` = 0 points

2. **Active Offers Count** (up to 30 points)
   - 50+ offers = 30 points
   - 30-49 offers = 24 points
   - 20-29 offers = 21 points
   - 15-19 offers = 18 points
   - 10-14 offers = 15 points
   - 5-9 offers = 12 points
   - 3-4 offers = 9 points
   - 2 offers = 6 points
   - 1 offer = 3 points

3. **Rating Score** (up to 15 points)
   - Based on store rating (3.0-4.5 scale)
   - Formula: `Math.min((rating - 3.0) * 10, 15)`

4. **Review Count Score** (up to 5 points)
   - Based on number of reviews
   - Formula: `Math.min(review_count / 100, 5)`

## Usage

### Standalone Execution
```bash
npm run sync:sitemap-popular-stores
```

### As Part of Daily Sync
```bash
npm run sync-today
```

## Script Output

    <lastmod>2025-08-26</lastmod>
    <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.9</priority>
  </url>
```

```javascript
{
  name: "Sitemap Popular Stores Update",
  command: "npm run sync:sitemap-popular-stores",
  description: "Update sitemap.xml with top 5 popular stores"
}
```

## Environment Requirements
