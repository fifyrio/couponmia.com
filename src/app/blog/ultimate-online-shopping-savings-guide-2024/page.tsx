# Frequently Asked Questions {#faqs}

## Q: How much time should I spend looking for deals on each purchase?

**A: It depends on the purchase value, but follow the "$10 per hour" rule.** If you can save $20 on an item by spending 2 hours researching, that's equivalent to earning $10 per hour tax-free. For purchases under $50, spend no more than 15-30 minutes. For purchases over $200, it's worth spending 2-3 hours to find the best deals.

**Quick reference:**
- **Under $25:** 5-10 minutes maximum
- **$25-$100:** 15-30 minutes 
- **$100-$500:** 1-2 hours
- **Over $500:** 2-4 hours (research can save hundreds)

## Q: Are cashback apps safe to use with my financial information?

**A: Legitimate cashback apps are generally safe,** but follow these security practices:

**Safe practices:**
- **Use major, established apps** like Rakuten, Honey, or TopCashback
- **Read privacy policies** to understand data usage
- **Never provide banking passwords** or sensitive account information
- **Use dedicated email addresses** for shopping to manage promotional emails

**Red flags to avoid:**
- **Apps requesting bank account passwords**
- **Unrealistic cashback rates** (over 50% consistently)
- **No customer service contact information**
- **Poor app store ratings** with complaints about non-payment

## Q: Do coupon codes ever expire, and how can I find the most current ones?

**A: Yes, most coupon codes have expiration dates,** but here's how to find the freshest codes:

**Best sources for current codes:**
- **Official retailer newsletters** (most reliable source)
- **Social media accounts** of brands (often exclusive codes)
- **Honey and Capital One Shopping** (automatically test current codes)
- **Deal forums** like Slickdeals (community-verified codes)

**Pro tip:** Codes typically follow patterns:
- **SAVE20, GET15OFF** (generic percentage codes)
- **WELCOME10** (new customer codes)
- **FLASH25** (limited-time offers)
- **SHIP50** (free shipping thresholds)

## Q: Can I use multiple discounts and coupon codes on the same purchase?

**A: It depends on the retailer's policy,** but here are stacking opportunities:

**Common stackable combinations:**
- **Store coupon + manufacturer coupon** (physical stores)
- **Percentage discount + free shipping code** (some online retailers)
- **Cashback apps + credit card rewards** (always stackable)
- **Store rewards program + promotional codes** (usually allowed)

**Generally not stackable:**
- **Multiple percentage-off codes** on the same site
- **Competing promotional offers** (buy-one-get-one vs. 50% off)

**Strategy:** Always try multiple codes â€“ the worst they can say is "code cannot be combined."

## Q: What's the difference between cashback rates at different apps, and which should I use?

**A: Cashback rates vary significantly between apps and even between merchants on the same app.** Here's how to maximize:

**Rate comparison strategy:**
- **Use comparison tools** like Cashback Monitor to compare rates across platforms
- **Check 3-4 major apps** before making large purchases
- **Consider payout terms** (some apps have minimum thresholds or delays)

**Best apps by category:**
- **Overall best rates:** TopCashback (but slower payouts)
- **Best user experience:** Rakuten (quarterly PayPal payments)
- **Best for travel:** Airline and hotel shopping portals
- **Best for credit card users:** Chase Ultimate Rewards or Amex Offers

**Pro tip:** For purchases over $100, always compare rates â€“ the difference can be $10-50+ on a single purchase.

## Q: How do I avoid fake or scam discount codes?

**A: Stick to legitimate sources and watch for warning signs:**

**Trusted sources:**
- **Official brand websites and newsletters**
- **Established coupon sites** (RetailMeNot, Coupons.com)
- **Browser extensions** from known companies
- **Deal forums** with community verification

**Warning signs of fake codes:**
- **Too good to be true discounts** (90% off regularly priced items)
- **Suspicious website URLs** with slight misspellings
- **Requests for personal information** beyond email
- **Codes that redirect** to unfamiliar websites

**Safety tip:** If a code seems suspicious, search for "[store name] + [code]" to see if others have verified it works.
